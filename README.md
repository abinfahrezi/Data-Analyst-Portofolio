## About

Hi, I'm **Abin Fahrezi**, a fresh graduate majoring in **Accounting** who is transitioning into the field of **Data Analysis**. I enjoy working with numbers, identifying patterns, and turning raw data into clear and useful insights.

My accounting background has strengthened my analytical thinking, attention to detail, and understanding of business data. I am currently building my data skills through hands-on projects using **Excel, SQL, and Python**, and I am excited to apply these skills in a real-world business environment.

I am seeking an opportunity as an **entry-level Data Analyst** where I can continue learning, grow professionally, and contribute through data-driven insights.
